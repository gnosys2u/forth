Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the \"Adventure\"\n\+
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky\n\+
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all\n\+
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed\n\+
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and\n\+
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves\n\+
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: \"DO\n\+
NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!\"  An immense mirror is hanging against one\n\+
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other\n\+
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance." "You're at NE end.")

  // The following description has several minor differences from Woods' original.
  // Woods' line breaks come after "A" on lines 4 and 5, "large" on line 6, and
  // "vault" on line 7. Knuth's "that reads" corresponds to Woods' "which reads";
  // presumably Knuth changed it to avoid ugly repetition, and I agree.

wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one\n\+
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.\n\+
A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.\n\+
A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a\n\+
large steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, \"TREASURE\n\+
