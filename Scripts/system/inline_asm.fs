asm[ does:

  compile _inlineAsm opcode
  push DP on rstack
  compile 0 (will be filled in by ]ASM)
  push assembler vocab on top of search stack
  set state to interpret

]asm does:

  compile jmp DI instruction
  round DP up to nearest longword
  pop address off rstack, store DP there
  set state to compile
  pop search stack

_inlineAsm

  on entry, IP points to longword with IP after the inline code
  set inlineAddress = IP + 4
  set IP = @IP
  non-turbo version will have to save & setup registers with SP, IP, inner interp re-entry point
  jump to inlineAddress
