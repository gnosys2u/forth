\  Keysym structure
\   - The scancode is hardware dependent, and should not be used by general
\     applications.  If no hardware scancode is available, it will be 0.
\ 
\   - The 'unicode' translated character is only available when character
\     translation is enabled by the SDL_EnableUNICODE() API.  If non-zero,
\     this is a UNICODE character corresponding to the keypress.  If the

\ Function prototypes

\ Pumps the event loop, gathering events from the input devices.
\ This function updates the event queue and internal input device state.
\ This should only be run in the thread that sets the video mode.

DLLVoid dll_0 SDL_PumpEvents	\ extern DECLSPEC void SDLCALL SDL_PumpEvents(void)

\ Checks the event queue for messages and optionally returns them.
\ If 'action' is SDL_ADDEVENT, up to 'numevents' events will be added to
\ the back of the event queue.
\ If 'action' is SDL_PEEKEVENT, up to 'numevents' events at the front
\ of the event queue, matching 'mask', will be returned and will not
\ be removed from the queue.
\ If 'action' is SDL_GETEVENT, up to 'numevents' events at the front 
\ of the event queue, matching 'mask', will be returned and will be
\ removed from the queue.
\ This function returns the number of events actually stored, or -1
\ if there was an error.  This function is thread-safe.

\ 
dll_4 SDL_PeepEvents		\ SDL_Event *events, int numevents, SDL_eventaction action, Uint32 mask

\ Polls for currently pending events, and returns 1 if there are any pending
\ events, or 0 if there are none available.  If 'event' is not NULL, the next
\ event is removed from the queue and stored in that area.

dll_1 SDL_PollEvent		\ (SDL_Event *event)

\ Waits indefinitely for the next available event, returning 1, or 0 if there
\ was an error while waiting for events.  If 'event' is not NULL, the next
\ event is removed from the queue and stored in that area.

dll_1 SDL_WaitEvent		\ (SDL_Event *event)

\ Add an event to the event queue.
\ This function returns 0 on success, or -1 if the event queue was full
\ or there was some other error.

dll_1 SDL_PushEvent		\ (SDL_Event *event)

\ 
\ This function sets up a filter to process all events before they
\ change internal state and are posted to the internal event queue.
\ The filter is protypted as:

\ typedef int (SDLCALL *SDL_EventFilter)(const SDL_Event *event)

\ If the filter returns 1, then the event will be added to the internal queue.
\ If it returns 0, then the event will be dropped from the queue, but the 
\ internal state will still be updated.  This allows selective filtering of
\ dynamically arriving events.

\ WARNING:  Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function, as 
\          it may run in a different thread!
\ There is one caveat when dealing with the SDL_QUITEVENT event type.  The
\ event filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the
\ application window.  If the event filter returns 1, then the window will
\ be closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible.
\ If the quit event is generated by an interrupt signal, it will bypass the
\ internal queue and be delivered to the application at the next event poll.

\ extern DECLSPEC void SDLCALL SDL_SetEventFilter(SDL_EventFilter filter)

\  Return the current event filter - can be used to "chain" filters.
\  If there is no event filter set, this function returns NULL.
\ extern DECLSPEC SDL_EventFilter SDLCALL SDL_GetEventFilter(void)

\ This function allows you to set the state of processing certain events.
\ If 'state' is set to SDL_IGNORE, that event will be automatically dropped
\ from the event queue and will not event be filtered.
\ If 'state' is set to SDL_ENABLE, that event will be processed normally.
\ If 'state' is set to SDL_QUERY, SDL_EventState() will return the 
\ current processing state of the specified event.
